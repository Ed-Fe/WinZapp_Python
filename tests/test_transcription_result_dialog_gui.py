"""The transcription result window, built for real.

Construction is the part the stub tests cannot see: where the focus starts,
whether the caveats field exists only when there are caveats, and that Escape
reaches the Close button. Builds a real wx.Dialog, so it carries the `wxgui`
marker and runs only where that is allowed (CI) — never on the machine of the
blind developers who maintain this, where a dialog taking focus has crashed
the screen reader.
