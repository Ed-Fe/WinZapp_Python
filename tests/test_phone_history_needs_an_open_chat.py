"""Who gets to put a notification on the user's phone.

Everything the backfill does is local and free except one step: asking the
phone for older history. That request lights up the user's own lock screen,
and when the phone cannot satisfy it the follow-up reads "Sync paused. Open
WhatsApp to resume." — an error, for a conversation they never opened.

Measured on the reporting install after the earlier rate and per-chat bounds
were already shipped: 82 chats short of the 200-message target, one phone
request every two minutes, marching through the account for hours. The bounds
held; the queue was simply the whole address book. The user's own summary,
twice: it should be following new messages, not fetching old history for other
conversations in the background.

So opening a conversation is the gate. It is the signal that its history is
worth something, and the moment a notification about it is welcome. Scrolling
up (fetch_older_messages) is unaffected and always was — that request is
attended by definition.
