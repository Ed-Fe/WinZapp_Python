"""HTTPS verified the way the machine verifies it, not the way we shipped it.

`requests` verifies against `certifi`'s baked-in CA list, which knows nothing
about the computer it runs on. On a machine whose TLS is intercepted locally —
an antivirus with HTTPS scanning on, a corporate proxy, an MDM profile — the
certificate presented is signed by a root that exists only in *Windows'* own
store, and every download fails with CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED. Measured on a
real install against huggingface.co, nodejs.org and api.github.com: all three
failed, all three worked once verification went through the system store.

Which is three unrelated features breaking at once, for a reason none of them
explains to the user: the Whisper models (up to 3 GB, and without them there is
no transcription), the portable Node.js runtime WinZapp needs before it can talk
to WhatsApp at all, and the updater.

The rules this file pins:

* **Absence is never an error.** No truststore, or a Windows that refuses to
  give a context, leaves an ordinary session behaving exactly as the code did
  before. A certificate helper that could take the updater down on import
  would be a worse bug than the one it fixes.
* **The proxy path counts too**, because a machine that intercepts TLS is very
  often the same machine that routes through a proxy.
* **Every internet download goes through it.** The three modules that fetch
  from outside `127.0.0.1` are checked by name — a fourth call site added later
  and left on bare `requests.get` would fail for that user with no clue why.
