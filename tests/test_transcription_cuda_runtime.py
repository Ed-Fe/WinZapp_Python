"""Fetching the CUDA library CTranslate2 opens by name, and proving it works.

Part 4a made "the GPU is counted but cuBLAS is nowhere on this machine" a
measured veto with a reason of its own. This is the other half — the download
that answers it — and the failures it has to survive are all failures the user
cannot see:

* **The wheel is pinned, whole.** URL, byte count and sha256 describe one
  published artifact, and the 12.9 series is not a taste: Blackwell (sm_120),
  the card the issue was reported from, needs cuBLAS kernels from 12.8 or
  newer. A URL that followed "the latest" would change the bytes under a digest
  that no longer describes them, and the only symptom would be the same silent
  fall back to the processor. The first class here fails if anyone loosens it.

* **1.3 GB has to be gated before the first byte.** The wheel and everything
  unpacked out of it are on disk at the same moment, so the gate counts the
  sum. Finding out afterwards means a full disk and a half-written install.

* **Nothing may be believed that was not checked.** The wheel is verified while
  the bytes go past; each extracted library is verified against the wheel's own
  RECORD; and no file appears under its final name before that. A cancelled or
  failed install leaves neither a `.part` nor a published file, because half a
  gigabyte of scratch in the shared global folder is invisible to the user and
  nothing else would ever collect it.

* **"It downloaded" is not the answer.** What comes back is
  `device.probe_cuda_libraries()`'s own verdict, measured after the directory is
  registered with the loader — a DLL that is present and will not load is
  exactly the state part 4a already vetoes the GPU for.

* **An install from last week has to be registered at startup**, or the user
  who paid for the download is silently back on the processor with nothing
  anywhere mentioning it.

The network is never touched: a synthetic wheel is built in the test and served
by a fake session. The one test that does reach PyPI — the safety net for "the
pinned link is still there" — is marked `network` and skipped unless
WINZAPP_RUN_NETWORK_TESTS is set.
