"""What the transcription settings mean, and what a stale one must not cost.

A settings.json outlives the version that wrote it, and every value in this
section names something that can stop existing: a model the catalogue retires,
a backend an install does not have, a language code that was never valid, a
device string from a WinZapp that spelled them differently. None of those is a
fault, so none of them may raise — but a silent swap is its own bug, and a
worse one for a blind user, who has no visual cue that the model actually
running is not the one the dialog is showing. So every fallback here is pinned
twice: that it happens, and that it is *reported*.

The two decisions that are easy to get backwards:

* **The interface language is a preference, never an override.** The issue asks
  for the configured language to be preferred, and the tempting reading — "the
  app is in Polish, so transcribe in Polish" — is the wrong one. Whisper handed
  a language the audio is not in does not fail; it confidently invents a
  transcription in that language, and a listener cannot tell that from a real
  one. The reporter runs the app in Polish and receives voice notes in other
  languages, so the default (detect each message on its own) must survive a
  Polish interface untouched. The interface language counts in exactly one
  place: the user turned detection off and never said which language instead.

* **The models folder is install-wide, and app_settings is what enforces it.**
  The files are shared by every account — one model is up to 3 GB, which is why
  they live under global_dir() — so an account pointing somewhere else while its
  siblings read the old folder is a state with no meaning. app_settings raises
  KeyError for anything that is not global, which is the mechanism that keeps
  this key out of a per-account settings.json by accident.

Nothing here probes anything: the hardware, the installed models and the usable
backends all arrive as arguments, which is what lets "what does a 4 GB card
get" be answered on a machine with no card at all.
