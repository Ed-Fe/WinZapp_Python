"""A transcription never reveals a chat the locked-chats vault has hidden.

The case this exists for: the vault is open with a short auto-lock, the user
presses Alt+Shift+T on a long voice note of a locked chat and waits without
touching a key. The timer fires inside the progress dialog's modal loop, the
vault closes the conversation and says so — and minutes later the run
finishes. Before this, the result window opened over the note of the chat the
app had just announced as locked, and read its text out.

So every way the flow shows or says anything about a result asks the vault
again at that moment (`MainWindow.is_chat_hidden_by_vault()`): the fresh
result, an empty one, the re-run on the processor, "Ver transcrição", and the
focus move back to the message — and "Inserir na mensagem" once the window
closes, since the vault can close while the user is reading in it. The result
is still kept when storing still finds the message with the conversation
closed, because keeping it reveals nothing and the user waited for it; one
sentence says whether it was.

The vault is the real one: `ChatLockVault` configured and holding the chat,
and the real `_on_chat_lock_timeout()` / `lock_chat_vault()` bound onto the
flow suite's window stub, fired from inside the job the way the timer fires
inside the modal loop. The harness — the fake dialogs, the job, the panel —
is tests/test_transcription_flow.py's, fixture included.
