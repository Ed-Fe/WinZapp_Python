"""Saying what happened, without saying anything that did not.

Part 6a turns a run's codes into i18n keys; part 6b only reads them out. Which
makes this the last place a false sentence can be caught, and three of them are
specific enough to be pinned:

* **"You asked for the processor", said to somebody who did not.**
  `device.device_reason_i18n_key()` answers that for every reason it does not
  recognise, None included — correct where it lives, since an unknown reason
  still ran somewhere. Read at the start of a run, before the hardware probe,
  both the device and the reason are None, and taking that answer at face value
  has the app confidently name a decision nobody made on a machine with a
  working graphics card.

* **A transcription produced without the voice filter, looking exactly like
  one produced with it.** `vad_used=False` means Whisper answered the silence
  at the end of a voice note with an invented sentence in the same voice as the
  real ones. There is no symptom, so there has to be a warning — unconditional,
  including on a result that is otherwise perfect and including on one with
  nothing in it.

* **A sentence naming a choice the user was never offered.** The language note
  fires whenever the detected language differs from `preferences.
  preferred_language()` — and on factory settings that answer is the interface
  language, resolved from the `interface` sentinel without consulting
  `auto_detect_language`, which is on, which is what greys the language
  combobox out in the tab. So the user who has never opened that dialog is
  precisely the one who hears this note most often, and the sentence has to be
  true for them too.

* **An empty window, which a screen-reader user cannot tell from a crash.**

Nothing here imports wx and nothing formats a string: every assertion is about
which key, with which values, in which order.
