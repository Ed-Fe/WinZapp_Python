"""Each person's about ("Sobre") as the bridge last read it from WhatsApp.

`profile-status/:phone` costs one usync query to WhatsApp's servers. The
client asks for it for every person it is trying to name (main_window/
identity.py's mention scan: two thousand at a launch), and WhatsApp Web
answers most of those from what it already knows; asking the server each
time drew a refusal every few seconds and risks the account. So an about is
kept for ABOUT_TTL, a refusal for FAILURE_TTL, and when the server says the
account is asking too much (429) nobody's about is asked for RATE_PAUSE.

Pure, with the clock passed in (tested in test_about_cache.py).
