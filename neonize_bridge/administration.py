"""Server and session routes of the bridge: server identity, documentation,
metrics, list and start sessions, QR and the "reconnect the stream" notice.

The response formats are the ones the WinZapp client reads (identity in
core/wpp_update_health.py and core/local_api_port.py; show-all-sessions in
main_window/wpp_server.py; reconnect-socket-stream in main_window/connection.py)
or, where the client does not use the route, those of WPPConnect Server
(api_patches/src/controller/sessionController.ts).

The pure functions are at the top (tested in test_administration.py);
`register_routes` wires the routes to the server. Nothing here imports neonize.

Left out, on purpose (COBERTURA.md explains): `collect-page-garbage` (the client
treats 404 as "this server does not have it" and stops asking; there is no
browser page to collect), `unhealthy`, `backup-sessions`, `restore-sessions`,
`chatwoot` and `clear-session-data`.
