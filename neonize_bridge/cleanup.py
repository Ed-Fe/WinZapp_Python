"""Deleting an account from the bridge: `POST /api/<token>/delete-session`.

Whoever deletes an account in WinZapp (or undoes a pairing) has to take along
what the bridge kept of it: the WhatsApp keys (`session.db`) and all the
messages in plain text (`bridge.db`), in `<folder>/<name>`. Only the bridge can
do that: it keeps both SQLite files open, and on Windows an open file cannot be
deleted. The route: logs the account out (the device stops being linked on the
phone), stops the session, releases the files, deletes the folder and removes
the name from `active.json`.

It requires the session's normal credential (the middleware in authentication.py
checks the `<name>:<hash>` of `/api/{tok}/...`), so an account can only delete
itself.

The pure functions are at the top (tested in test_cleanup.py). Nothing here
imports neonize.
