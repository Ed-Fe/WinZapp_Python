"""Contact updates of the bridge: the Socket.IO `contacts.update` event, which
the client reads in core/websocket_client.py (`on_contacts_update`) to keep the
contacts' name (`pushName`) and photo (`profilePicUrl`) up to date without a
full sync.

What the client reads from `data` (a dictionary or a list of them), and only
this: `remoteJid` (normalized by it; a `@lid` is tied to the number by its map),
`pushName` (replaces the stored name) and `profilePicUrl` (replaces the stored
URL). With neither of the two the event changes nothing, and a `pushName` of
someone it does not know creates the contact. That is why a `@lid` with no known
number never carries a name from here (it would create a contact with the LID
key), and the photo only goes with the URL.

Sources in neonize 0.5.2 (what the proto descriptor confirms):
- `PictureEv` (JID, Author, Timestamp, Remove) only says the photo changed, it
  does not bring the URL; that comes from `get_profile_picture` on a thread,
  outside the handler (it is a network call). A removed photo is not emitted:
  the client ignores an empty URL.
- The name comes from the `Info.Pushname` of each received message
  (`announce_name`, which server.py's `MessageEv` handler calls: neonize keeps a
  single handler per event, so another cannot be registered here) and from the
  history package. neonize's test build may have contact events (PushName,
  Contact); none of their fields was confirmed, so nothing uses them.

Each fact is only emitted when it changes from the last one emitted
(`Announced`, in RAM): the bridge's store already keeps the names and is not
resent. The pure functions are at the top (tested in test_contact_events.py).
Nothing here was proven against a real account. No JID or name goes to the log.
