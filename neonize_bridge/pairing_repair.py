"""Repairs a pairing that WhatsApp refused after the QR was scanned.

whatsmeow only writes the refusal in its log. Two lines matter:

- `Failed to pair device: invalid device identity HMAC`: the QR on screen no
  longer matches the keys the client holds (the server rotated the ADV key, or
  a pairing code was asked for in the same connection). Scanning it can never
  work; the connection has to start again with new keys to get a QR that does.
- `Failed to handle code pair notification`: the same for a pairing code.

TeleZapp lives with the same whatsmeow and fixed it by listening to that log,
wiping the session keys and starting over, at most 3 times (its CHANGELOG,
2026.10.21). Here the QR failure restarts the pairing and the code failure only
tells the client: a new code would be minted for a number nobody asked about,
and the per-number quota outlives the process (docs/traps/pairing-flow.md).
Pure functions and a log handler; the restart itself is `Session`'s.
