"""Commit provenance of a macOS release: does it declare an official tag and
commit that WinZapp's own repository confirms?

The Mac releases are published from another repository (Info.plist
WinZappMacReleasesRepo), so the Apple signature only says "the Mac
maintainer's Apple team signed this", never "this code went through
gabrielhhaber/WinZapp_Python". Each Mac release therefore DECLARES, in a
provenance file, an official tag and commit, and the updater checks that
declaration against the OFFICIAL repository before installing. It does not
prove the zip was built from that commit. Pure standard library on purpose: no PyObjC, no wx, so the
normal Windows `pytest` exercises it and macos/build_app.py (which runs
before any dependency is installed) can use it too.

Threat model
  Attacker: whoever controls the releases repository (a fork, its CI secrets,
  its release assets) and can publish any zip and any provenance there.
  Cannot: push a tag to the official repository, or make api.github.com
  answer for it. The official repository's write access is the trust root the
  Windows releases already rely on.
  Goal: a Mac release that cannot name one of our tags and its commit must
  not install. A stronger guarantee (the zip IS that commit's build) needs an
  attestation from a workflow of the official repository, or a maintainer
  signature over the zip hash like Windows.

What is verified (in this order, every step fails closed)
  1. The provenance file is well formed: exact keys, schema 1, source_repo is
     the pinned official repository, source_commit 40 lowercase hex, version a
     release tag, artifacts a small name -> sha256 map.
  2. Its version is the tag of the release being installed (no replaying the
     provenance of another release) and is newer than the running version,
     which is the official tag the app was built from (Info.plist
     WinZappReleaseTag), never client/version.py.
  3. Over HTTPS, no redirects, against api.github.com/repos/<OFFICIAL_REPO>
     only: the tag exists in the official repository and, peeled through
     annotated tag objects, points at exactly source_commit.
  4. The downloaded zip's sha256 equals artifacts[<zip name>].

Why the tag, and not "the commit exists in our repo"
  GitHub serves a fork's commits through the parent repository
  (/repos/<parent>/commits/<sha> answers 200 for them), so existence proves
  nothing. A tag can only be created in the official repository by someone
  with write access to it, which a fork's owner does not have. A compare
  against the default branch would additionally prove "reachable from main",
  but it costs another API call (the unauthenticated limit is 60 an hour) and
  would refuse a legitimate hotfix tag on another branch; the tag is already
  the maintainer's explicit act, so it is the check used.

What this does NOT prove
  That the zip was built from that commit. The releaser can build from a
  modified tree and name an honest commit. build_app.py refuses a dirty tree
  and a HEAD that is not the tag, but that runs on the releaser's machine.
  Only a reproducible build or a CI attestation checked by the updater
  (docs/reference/macos.md, "Commit provenance") would prove it. Tags can
  also be created or moved by anyone with write access: the tag rules of the
  official repository are the real limit. Known gap: the ruleset "Allow tag
  creation only for admins" excludes refs/tags/v*alpha, so a collaborator with
  write access can create or move an alpha tag. Recommended to the maintainer:
  cover alpha tags too (or restrict them to the alpha workflow).
