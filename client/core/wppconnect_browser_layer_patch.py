"""Patch for @wppconnect-team/wppconnect's compiled controllers/browser.js —
a large account whose WhatsApp Web needs a little over 30 s to become ready
never connects (issue #414).

`injectApi()` injects wa-js and then waits for the page to be usable:

    await page.waitForFunction(() => {
        return (typeof window.WAPI !== 'undefined' &&
            typeof window.Store !== 'undefined' &&
            window.WPP.isReady);
    });

with no timeout of its own, so puppeteer's default of 30 s applies. Reported
on an account with 616 chats and a 25.8 MB IndexedDB store, which needs 32 to
35 s to hydrate: the wait threw `TimeoutError: Waiting failed: 30000ms
exceeded` at 30.0 s, `create()` failed and the session was reset to CLOSED,
and the page reported its WhatsApp Web version 2.7 s later. Nothing in that
loop changes on the next attempt, so the same account fails the same way
every time — on WinZapp's bundled server too, where the failed start leaves
Chrome holding the profile and the next start has to kill it first.

Fix: give that one wait its own timeout, `INJECT_API_READY_TIMEOUT_MS`.
60 s rather than the 90 s the report used: the power-resume path restarts a
session that has made no progress for `_RESUME_INITIALIZING_GRACE` (90 s,
main_window/connection.py), and a start that may legitimately wait 90 s for
this alone would be cut off by it. A profile that never becomes ready still
fails, 30 s later than before — which only stretches each failed cycle the
profile-health tracker counts (core/profile_recovery.py); the pairing-code
route, the faster of the two, does not wait on it.

Only this wait changes. `page.setDefaultTimeout()` would have reached it
without a patch, but it moves every other puppeteer wait on the page with it.

Matched by structure, not by one literal, so indentation and line endings do
not matter. Like the wa-js bundle patch, this module owns the file handling:
the three call sites (setup_api.py, build_api.py and
ApiSetupDialog._apply_node_modules_patches()) pass the outer client/api
directory to patch_browser_controller().
