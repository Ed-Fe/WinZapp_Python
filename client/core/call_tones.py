"""The tones WhatsApp plays itself during a call, made by WinZapp.

With the WPPConnect engine the WhatsApp Web page in the background plays them
(the ringback of the country dialed, the connecting and reconnecting beeps, the
busy signal). The Neonize engine has no page, so WinZapp makes the same tones.
They are plain synthesized tones -- one or two sine waves on a cadence -- and the
numbers come from the desktop client of WhatsApp (see ``call_tone_data``).

Pure functions, no wx and no audio device: ``synthesize_wav`` returns the bytes of
a WAV file holding one period of the tone, to be played in a loop.
