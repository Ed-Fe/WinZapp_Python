"""Deleting an account's data from the neonize bridge.

With the Neonize engine the WhatsApp keys and every message of an account live
in ``neonize_bridge/dados-real/<session>/`` (``sessao.db``, ``ponte.db``),
which only the bridge can remove: it keeps both files open. Removing an account
(account_removal.py) and cleaning up abandoned pairing attempts therefore ask
the bridge, through its ``delete-session`` route (neonize_bridge/limpeza.py),
which logs the device out, stops the session and removes the folder.

The HTTP call is a parameter, so the rules are tested without a bridge.
