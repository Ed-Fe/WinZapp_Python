"""What the installed @wppconnect/wa-version catalogue says about calls.

Calls depend on the WhatsApp Web build, and the build is picked from the
catalogue in client/api/node_modules/@wppconnect/wa-version/versions.json.
core/wa_version_refresh.py stages a newer package at startup and applies it
the next time Node is spawned; a rebuilt node_modules (an in-app WPPConnect
reinstall) also refreshes it. docs/traps/voice-calls.md measured the line: an
install whose newest entry was 2.3000.1046948731-alpha never initialised VoIP;
after a reinstall its catalogue reached 2.3000.1047835881-alpha and calls
worked.

The one-time "reinstall WPPConnect" notice for pre-2.0 accounts
(MainWindow._show_wpp_reinstall_notice_if_pending) asks this before showing
itself, so an install that was already reinstalled — every alpha tester was
told to do it by hand — is not told again that it may lack calls.
