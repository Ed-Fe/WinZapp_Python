"""How much of the speaker's audio is in the call microphone, for the log.

Pure numpy, no devices: CallAudioProcessor keeps the last seconds of the
speaker reference, the microphone and what it sent, and logs echo_coupling()
of each against the reference, so a report of "they still hear themselves"
says whether the echo was in the microphone, whether the canceller removed
it, and how late it arrived.
