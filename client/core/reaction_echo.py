"""Recognising the echo of a reaction WinZapp itself just sent.

A reaction sent from WinZapp is drawn at once (the optimistic row update in
ui/conversation_panel/reactions.py), and WhatsApp then echoes it back over the
WebSocket as a `fromMe` reaction — twice, through received-message and through
onreactionmessage. That echo must be dropped, or the reaction is counted
again. A `fromMe` reaction made on the phone or another linked device looks
exactly the same and must NOT be dropped, so a send leaves a short-lived
marker (`MainWindow._pending_own_reactions`) and only an echo matching it is
suppressed.

What it matches on is the whole point. The marker used to be (message id,
emoji), with no chat: a message id is only unique within its chat, so a
reaction made on the phone to another chat's message with the same id and the
same emoji, within the window, was swallowed as if it were WinZapp's echo.
The chat is part of the key now, and because one chat reaches here under
several spellings — send_reaction() swaps a phone JID for its @lid before
sending, and the echo comes back as @lid, @c.us or @s.whatsapp.net — every
spelling known for it counts as the same chat.

Pure: no wx, no MainWindow. The callers pass the @lid/phone maps in.
