"""Which own messages can be sent again by hand, and with what.

A send that failed (``_send_failed``: the queue gave up) or that WinZapp never
saw confirmed (``_send_unconfirmed``: it timed out with an unknown outcome)
gets "Try sending again" in the message's menu and on its key. It is never
retried automatically: an unconfirmed one may have gone out, so trying again
is the user's call.

A text resends its wire text. An attachment resends the file it was sent
from, recorded on the pending row as ``RESEND_PATH_KEY`` when it was queued
(ui/conversation_panel/attachments.py); without that file (moved, deleted, or
a recording WinZapp made and removed) there is nothing to send again.
