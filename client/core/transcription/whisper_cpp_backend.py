"""whisper.cpp as a WinZapp transcription backend: whisper-cli, run per note.

What differs from faster_whisper_backend, and why it is shaped this way:

* **A separate program, not a library.** whisper-cli.exe (whisper_cpp_runtime
  downloads it) runs once per transcription as a child process, the way
  audio_prep runs ffmpeg: no console window, stdin closed, stderr into a file
  rather than a pipe nobody drains, polled in short slices so a cancellation
  kills it rather than waiting. It also runs at below-normal priority on
  Windows: it is meant to take every core it is given, and a screen reader
  starved of CPU stops speaking — for a blind user the whole machine has then
  stopped answering.

* **Nothing stays loaded.** The program loads the model, transcribes and
  exits, so there is no cache to keep warm and no VRAM to hand back —
  `release()` has nothing to do — and the price is the load, paid inside every
  run. `load_model()` therefore only checks that the model file and the
  program are there, so a missing one is reported before the "transcribing"
  phase rather than half way into it.

* **Nothing leaves the machine.** The program is handed a local model file
  and a local WAV — paths, never a URL or a model name it could go and fetch;
  the files it reads were downloaded and verified by model_store and
  whisper_cpp_runtime.

* **The words never pass through anything that logs.** The text is read from
  the JSON file `-oj` writes into a private temporary folder (deleted however
  the run ends); stdout, where the program prints the same words, goes to the
  null device; stderr — progress, the detected language, failures — is what
  an error detail may quote, and whisper_cpp_cli.log_tail() drops anything
  shaped like a segment from it besides.

* **The voice-activity filter is a preference, as in faster-whisper.** It
  needs its own model file (whisper_cpp_catalog.VAD_MODEL). Missing, or failing
  to load, it costs the filter and never the transcription — and the result
  says so through `vad_used=False`, because without it a note ending in silence
  can come back with an invented last sentence the listener cannot detect.

The device arrives decided (device.py), and picks the build: "cuda" runs the
CUDA build, and anything else runs the CPU build with `-ng`. "cuda" is not
trusted on its own, though: the CUDA build of this release has no Blackwell
kernels, so it is used only when the request's `compute_capability` — the one
the job's probe measured, carried in the request like every other decision —
passes whisper_cpp_builds.cuda_build_supported(). Unknown, or sm_120 and
newer, is CUDA_UNAVAILABLE, as is a CUDA build that is not installed: the code
the job already answers with an offer to run on the processor. The compute
type does not apply here: the precision is the GGML file's quantization, which
the result reports instead.
