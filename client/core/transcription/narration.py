"""What a transcription tells the user, as keys and values rather than text.

Everything below the UI speaks in codes — phases, device reasons, error codes —
precisely so the sentence can be in the user's own language. This module is
where those codes become a sentence's *identity*: an i18n key and the values it
is formatted with. It does not format anything and it does not import wx, so
part 6b receives a list of things to say and only decides how to say them —
which is `management.announcement()`'s arrangement, reused here rather than
reinvented, down to the `Announcement` type itself so the UI handles one shape.

Two things this module exists to get right, both of which are silent failures
if it does not:

* **The voice-activity filter is the one downgrade a listener cannot detect.**
  `TranscriptionResult.vad_used` is False when the filter could not load, and
  Whisper without it answers the silence at the end of a voice note with an
  invented sentence in the same voice as the real ones. There is no way to hear
  the difference, so the only protection is saying it happened — unconditionally,
  even for a result that is otherwise perfect, and even for one with nothing in
  it. Everything else here is a convenience; this is the reason.

* **A reason that is not known is not announced.** `device_reason_i18n_key()`
  answers "you asked for the processor" for anything it does not recognise,
  including None — a deliberate choice there, since an unknown *reason* still
  ran somewhere and that is the safer of the two sentences. Taken at face value
  at the start of a run, though, it produces the app confidently telling a user
  with a working graphics card that they asked for the processor, which they
  did not. So a reason this module does not recognise produces no sentence at
  all, and job.py's own comment about announcing before the probe is the state
  that reaches it.
