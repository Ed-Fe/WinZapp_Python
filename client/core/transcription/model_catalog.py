"""The Whisper models WinZapp offers, as data.

Models are not shipped inside the installer — a single one of them is bigger
than the whole app — so they are downloaded from Hugging Face on demand. That
makes the catalogue a contract with a remote repository: the revisions, file
names, file sizes and the model.bin digest below were read from the Hugging
Face API on 2026-09-03 and are what the download and the "this model is
complete" check are measured against.

Three details of that contract are easy to get wrong and expensive afterwards:

* **The file list is not uniform.** The Systran tiny..medium conversions ship
  ``vocabulary.txt`` and no ``preprocessor_config.json``, while large-v3 and the
  turbo conversion ship ``vocabulary.json`` *and* ``preprocessor_config.json``.
  Assuming one shape leaves a "complete" model that CTranslate2 refuses to load,
  which is indistinguishable to the user from a corrupted download.
* **Every model is pinned to a revision.** Downloads go to
  ``.../resolve/<revision>/...`` rather than ``/main/``, so a new revision
  published upstream cannot invalidate the byte counts here or swap the weights
  under an install that already verified them. Because the revision is pinned,
  every size below is a constant, not an estimate — which is what lets
  MODEL_CORRUPTED mean "missing or the wrong size" for *every* file rather than
  only for model.bin.
* **The totals are sums, never guesses.** They used to add an approximated
  couple of megabytes for the auxiliary files, and on the turbo conversion that
  guess was 181 KB *under* the real figure — an error in the wrong direction for
  a number that feeds a "does this fit?" gate.

Not every model is OpenAI's Whisper as published. Some are trained on one
language only — the `.en` and distilled conversions on English, and the
third-party fine-tunes (KBLab's Swedish, ivrit.ai's Hebrew and Yiddish,
Kotoba's Japanese) on theirs — and those carry that `language`: such a model
cannot detect a language or transcribe another one, so a run forces its
language and says so (preferences.resolve()). The third-party ones also carry
their `origin` and `publisher`, which the picker says beside the name: their
quality and licence are the publisher's, not Whisper's. Their repositories
hold more than the conversion (model.safetensors, an onnx/ folder): only the
files listed here are ever fetched.

No user-facing text lives here, only ids and i18n keys: the size classes are
what the model picker labels "fast / balanced / accurate", and translating them
is the UI layer's job. A publisher's name is a proper name and is shown as it
is.
