"""Plaintext a crashed run left in %TEMP%, removed at the next start.

A transcription writes the decrypted voice note, its converted WAV and
whisper.cpp's output into the system temp folder under random names, and
deletes them when it ends. A process killed in the middle (a crash, a power
cut, Task Manager) never gets to, and %TEMP% is not a private place. The day
of grace is what keeps this from touching a run another WinZapp account on
the same machine is in the middle of: a transcription of a long recording on a
slow machine outlasts an hour, and what a live run still holds open is left by
the delete's own refusal, not by guesswork about its age.
