"""Where a transcription runs, and in which precision.

Probing and deciding are two different things and are kept apart on purpose.
Probing means loading the NVIDIA driver's own DLL and asking CTranslate2 how
many CUDA devices it can see — machine-specific, allowed to fail in a dozen
ways, and impossible to reproduce in a test. Deciding is a handful of
comparisons. So `probe_hardware()` is the only function here that touches the
machine, it returns its findings as a plain frozen dataclass, and every
decision function takes that dataclass as an argument. That is what lets the
"RTX 50xx picks the wrong precision" family of bugs be pinned by a test on a
machine with no GPU at all.

Nothing in this module raises for a hardware reason. A user who asked for CUDA
on a machine that has none gets the CPU and a reason code saying so — being
told is the point, failing is not, and for a blind user an error dialog in
place of a transcription is strictly worse than a slower transcription.

**Probe immediately before deciding, and never reuse a probe.**
available_memory_mb() plans against memory that is *free*, so when the probe
ran is part of the answer. A probe taken at startup is taken before Chromium
has loaded WhatsApp Web, before the media cache has filled and possibly before
the screen reader is even up: it reports the high number this module already
says is misleading, and auto_select_model() would then pick a model against
memory that no longer exists by the time it loads. probe_hardware() costs one
DLL load and three driver calls, which is nothing next to a transcription, so
call it at the point of decision every time.

# shipped wheel (ctranslate2 4.8.2, the CUDA 12 Windows build) rather than off
# the documentation, because the two disagree:
#
# * ctranslate2.dll's import table names no CUDA library at all — the CUDA
#   runtime is linked statically — so importing the module proves nothing, and
#   `get_cuda_device_count()` needs only the driver's own nvcuda.dll. Its
#   *strings* carry "cublas64_12.dll" next to cublasCreate_v2/cublasGemmEx:
#   cuBLAS is opened with LoadLibrary the first time a model goes on the GPU,
#   and no package in requirements.txt ships it. That is the whole bug — on
#   every machine with a driver but no CUDA Toolkit the device is counted, cuda
#   is chosen, and the model load dies with "Could not load library
#   cublas64_12.dll".
# * cuBLAS's own import table names cublasLt64_12.dll, so loading cuBLAS by
#   name covers both: the Windows loader resolves the chain, and a missing
#   cublasLt fails this check exactly as it would fail the model load.
# * cuDNN is **not** in this list, and that is a finding rather than an
#   omission. The wheel ships a 266 KB cudnn64_9.dll, which is only the cuDNN 9
#   loader shim (it forwards to cudnn_graph/ops/cnn/adv64_9.dll, none of which
#   are shipped) and which ctranslate2/__init__.py loads with a blanket
#   CDLL(*.dll) at import. But this build of ctranslate2.dll references cuDNN

    the path is what lets `probe_cuda_libraries()` name an absolute file, so a
    registered directory is checked whether or not the loader's own search
    order happens to reach it.

    Answers "was it registered", which is not yet "can the GPU be used now":
    that stays `probe_cuda_libraries()`'s answer, and registering here
    invalidates its memoized one so the next call measures again. Part 4b asks
    both, in that order, when its download finishes — and
    `cuda_runtime_present_in()` before it, to know whether to download at all.

    Idempotent, and never raises: it runs as a download finishes, and a
    directory that turned out not to be there is a reason to keep using the
    CPU, not to take the app down.

    (`ctypes/__init__.py::CDLL._load_library`), while CTranslate2 opens cuBLAS
    from inside ctranslate2.dll with a raw LoadLibrary that obeys the
    *process's* search order. The two agree under python.exe and disagree in a
    frozen build, whose PyInstaller bootloader calls the legacy SetDllDirectory

    DLL reachable only through PATH — which is exactly where the CUDA Toolkit
    installer puts it, and PyTorch and other ML tooling with it — the default
    flags made this check answer "missing" while the run itself would have
    loaded it. The user would then be told, falsely, that the CUDA libraries
    are not installed, and watch large-v3 run about an order of magnitude
    slower on the CPU with nothing to retry, because the veto happens before
    the run. `winmode=0` asks the question the way the run asks it.

    path there is a folder we put the libraries in ourselves, and those flags
    are what let a dependency like cuBLASLt resolve out of that same folder.

    Erring permissive is the safe side of this asymmetry: a load that then
    fails inside CTranslate2 is classified CUDA_UNAVAILABLE, which is in
    CPU_RETRY_I18N_KEYS, so it becomes an offer to re-run on the CPU with the
    audio already converted. A false refusal has no recovery at all.
