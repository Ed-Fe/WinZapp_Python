"""From a WhatsApp message to a plain audio file ffmpeg can open.

`audio_prep` converts *a file* into what Whisper wants. This module answers the
question before it: which file, and how to get at it — WinZapp stores message
media encrypted, under a name derived from the message id, in one of two
folders depending on the type.

Three decisions carry this module, and the first one is the important one.

* **An audio WinZapp cannot identify is refused here, so that it is refused in
  the right words.** The one real case being turned away is a voice note
  recorded here: it falls back to writing **raw PCM** into the `.msv` when the
  OGG encode fails (`ogg_bytes or audio_data` in
  `ui/conversation_panel/voice_recording.py`), and the sample rate and channel
  count it was captured at (`_recording_actual_rate` / `_recording_actual_ch`)
  are not written anywhere in that file, so there is no saving it.

  What this sniff is *not* protecting against is an invented transcription.
  Measured against the bundled `client/lib/ffmpeg.exe` with `audio_prep`'s own
  arguments — which pass `-i <file>` and never `-f s16le -ar N` — raw PCM is
  refused under every extension a mimetype could suggest (`.ogg`, `.mp3`,
  `.wav`, `.m4a`, and the ones added since): ffmpeg only reads headerless PCM at
  a guessed rate when it is *told* the format, which this code never does. What
  varies is the **wording** of the refusal, and with it the sentence the user
  hears — and it varies with the content of the samples as much as with the
  extension: the same extension was measured to come back as
  UNSUPPORTED_AUDIO_FORMAT for one recording and as the generic FFMPEG_FAILED
  for another, and a stderr that happens to match audio_prep's truncation
  markers reports a damaged recording (AUDIO_INCOMPLETE) instead. No table of
  "this extension earns that sentence" holds. Sniffing first is what makes the
  answer UNSUPPORTED_AUDIO_FORMAT every time — the one sentence of the three a
  blind user can act on.

  Which is also why the table is not kept narrow. A format the bundled ffmpeg
  opens must not be refused here: FLAC, ADTS AAC, WebM/Matroska, AMR, AIFF and
  WMA all arrive in practice (`_resolve_media_filename()` keeps `audio/aac`,
  `audio/flac`, `audio/opus` and `audio/webm` in its own table and
  `_toggle_playback()` plays those files), and each one below was confirmed to
  convert through `audio_prep`'s exact command before it was added. None stays
  fatal, but it now means "nothing recognised it", not "it was not one of four".

* **The id is cleaned the way the media downloader cleans it, not the way
  `local_media_cache_paths()` does.** Two rules genuinely coexist in this
  repository: `local_media_cache_paths()` takes the raw id (it names files the
  *sender* side wrote, under a local UUID that has no underscores), while
  `_save_message_media()` and the Save As flow strip a `false_<jid>_<id>`
  prefix down to its third part. A transcription reads a file that WhatsApp's
  own download wrote — `handle_audio_message()` / `handle_media_message()`,
  reached through that same Save As path — so it follows that rule. Using the
  raw id here would simply miss the file on every message whose id carries the
  prefix.

* **Nothing here may reach the log.** The temporary holds the decrypted audio
  of a private conversation and the `.msv` is named after the message id, so
  neither path, neither file name and no id is ever logged — the same rule
  job.py states and `tests/test_transcription_message_audio.py` enforces
  statically. That covers the `detail` of every error raised here too, since
  `detail` is precisely what job.py writes to the log: it is built from error
  numbers and type names, never from an exception's own text, which for an
  `open()` failure quotes the path. The temporary is written under a random
  name for the same reason, and is deleted on success, on failure, on
  cancellation and on a re-run.

    than matched against a list of byte pairs: a list is what this used to be,
    and it kept being short, because every combination of MPEG version (1, 2,
    2.5) and CRC flag is a different second byte, and so is ADTS's CRC flag.
    Each one left out was a file ffmpeg converts being refused here.

    Both open with the same 11 set bits. The two-bit *layer* field after them
    separates them: 00 is reserved in MPEG audio, and it is exactly what ADTS
    writes, behind a 12-bit sync. Any other layer is MPEG audio — layers I and
    II included, which ffmpeg's mp3 demuxer reads as well. What is refused

    The caller then demands a *second* header where this one says the next

    a whole recording — and measured against the bundled ffmpeg, pink noise
    behind a fake MPEG header came back as the generic FFMPEG_FAILED instead of
    UNSUPPORTED_AUDIO_FORMAT. A second header, at the one offset the first
