"""What a transcription backend is, and which one a transcription uses.

There are two backends — faster-whisper, and whisper.cpp since part 9b — and
the shape was drawn while there was only the first, so nothing had to be
migrated to add the second. It is deliberately the smallest thing that answers the three questions
the rest of the app has: what this backend is called, whether it can run on
*this* machine, and transcribe this file.

Two of those are load-bearing beyond the interface:

* **`is_available()` may not raise, and may not import the backend either.** It
  is what the settings UI asks before offering a backend at all, and the
  machine it is asked on is precisely the one where the package may be missing
  or half-installed. Importing to find out would also load a few hundred
  megabytes of CUDA DLLs to answer a yes/no question — on the UI thread, every
  time the dialog is drawn.

* **Choosing is data, not discovery.** `BACKEND_IDS` is a tuple in preference
  order; a configured id wins if it can run, otherwise the first one that can.
  No entry-point scanning and no registration decorators: a dynamic plugin list
  would make "why is transcription unavailable here?" unanswerable from a log.

The request carries the *decisions*, never the machinery that made them: the
device and the compute type are resolved by device.py immediately before the
run (see its docstring on why a probe is never reused) and passed in. A backend
that decided for itself would be a second answer to a question that already has
one, and the sm_120 int8 rule would then have to be true in two places.
