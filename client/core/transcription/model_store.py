"""Where the Whisper models live on disk, and how they get there.

The catalogue (see model_catalog) says what a model is; this module is the only
thing that puts those bytes on a disk, checks them, and takes them away again —
for the whisper.cpp GGML files too (whisper_cpp_catalog entries answer the same
names; see whisper_cpp_store).
These decisions are worth more than the code implementing them:

* **The root is global, not per account.** WinZapp runs one account per
  process, so anything under ``data_path()`` is downloaded once *per account* —
  and large-v3 is 3 GB. The weights are read-only and hold nothing
  account-specific, so ``default_models_dir()`` answers with ``global_dir()``.
  Every other function takes the root as an argument, because part 5 lets the
  user point it somewhere else entirely.

* **Being global means being shared, so every mutation takes a lock.** Two
  account processes asking for the same model would otherwise open the same
  ``model.bin.part``, interleave their writes, both fail the digest, and each
  one's cleanup would delete the file the other is still streaming into.
  ``coord_locks.models_lock()`` is that lock; it is keyed on the *canonical*
  root, which is also how two spellings of one directory are recognised as one
  (Windows folds case and resolves junctions and ``subst`` drives — ``abspath``
  does not).

* **A file under its final name is a promise.** "Is this model installed?" is
  asked every time the model list is drawn and before every transcription, so
  it can only afford existence plus an exact size — 3 GB of hashing cannot run
  on that path. Which means a file carrying the catalogue's name and size
  *will* be believed, so nothing may ever appear under its final name before it
  has been verified — and the data has to be on the platter before the rename,
  since NTFS journals the rename and not the bytes.

* **The digest is computed while the bytes go past**, and re-seeded from the
  ``.part`` already on disk when a transfer resumes. model.bin is up to 3 GB;
  hashing it in a second pass would double the I/O of every download for a
  number the transfer already had in its hands, and re-fetching it because a
  user cancelled at 90% is how a feature gets used exactly once.

* **Only the catalogue's own file names are ever deleted.** ``remove_model()``
  unlinks exactly those names and then calls ``os.rmdir()``, which refuses a
  directory still holding anything else. Never ``shutil.rmtree()``: the root is
  user-chosen, somebody will point it at a folder that already has their own
  files in it, and a recursive delete of a user-chosen path only has to be
  wrong once.

**A note for the UI layer on the progress callbacks.** ``progress(done, total)``
is reported per chunk, which is every 1 MB — around 3000 calls for large-v3, and
`total` means something different per call site: the whole model for
``download_model()``, the digested files for ``verify_model()`` (model.bin for
a faster-whisper model, the one .bin for a whisper.cpp file), and every file
being moved for ``move_models()``. Part 5 has to throttle before any
``wx.CallAfter`` or spoken percentage; forwarding these straight through would
flood the UI thread and have the screen reader read thousands of numbers.

No user-facing text lives here either: failures travel as TranscriptionError
codes, and turning one into a sentence is the UI layer's job.
