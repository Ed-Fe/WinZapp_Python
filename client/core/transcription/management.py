"""The settings tab's management actions, as logic the tab only has to wire.

Downloading, repairing, verifying and removing a model, moving the models
folder, and installing, repairing, verifying and removing the CUDA libraries:
model_store and cuda_runtime already do every one of these correctly. What
they cannot do is be *called from a settings tab* as they stand, and the gap
is four problems that each look small and each have a user on the other end:

* **They report progress per megabyte.** ~3000 calls for large-v3. One
  `wx.CallAfter` per call floods the UI thread, and one spoken percentage per
  call has the screen reader read numbers for the whole download. So progress
  goes through `ProgressThrottle`, which answers two questions separately —
  "is it time to move the bar?" and "is this worth saying out loud?" — because
  they have very different budgets.

* **The user has to know what they are agreeing to before the bytes start.**
  The issue asks for the model's name, the download size, the disk it needs,
  where it goes and whether it will run on the processor or the card — *before*
  a multi-gigabyte download. `model_download_summary()` and
  `cuda_runtime_download_summary()` put that together as data; the tab owns
  the wording.

* **They block, and some of them block for half an hour.** `ManagementJob` runs
  one action on its own thread in the shape `job.TranscriptionJob` already
  set: cooperative cancel, callbacks through a guard, and exactly one finished
  report whatever happens.

* **Their outcomes are not sentences, and several are not failures.** A removal
  that leaves the libraries behind because a transcription mapped them, an
  install whose card still cannot use what is on disk, a folder move that got
  three models across and not the other two, a cancellation: none of these is
  the error message the code would suggest. `announcement()` decides which
  sentence each one gets.

Nothing here imports wx — every callback runs on a worker thread and part 5c-2
wraps it in `wx.CallAfter`, the split core/message_queue.py and job.py make —
and nothing here retries on its own. The CUDA download cannot resume, so a
second attempt on a bad line is another 553 MB; whether that is worth it is
the user's call, not this module's.
