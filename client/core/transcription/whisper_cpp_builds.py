"""Which whisper.cpp builds exist, which a machine is offered, and zip names.

The pinned release as data, and the pure decisions about it, apart from the
module that downloads and installs (whisper_cpp_runtime) so they can be read —
and tested — without a disk or a network:

* **One release, pinned whole, by digest.** Tag b4938; every zip below was
  measured on the release page and through the GitHub API, which agreed. The
  URL names the tag, never "latest", so a new release cannot swap the bytes
  under a digest that no longer describes them.

* **Two builds are offered, of the six published.** The CPU build
  (`whisper-bin-x64.zip`, 8 MB) always: it runs everywhere and is the
  fallback of every other answer. The CUDA 12.4 build (671 MB) only to an
  NVIDIA card whose compute capability is known and lies in [5.0, 12.0) —
  `cuda_build_supported()`. The ceiling is the reason this rule exists: both
  CUDA builds of this release predate Blackwell, and on sm_120 a build with no
  kernels for it fails at run time after the user waited through 671 MB; the
  floor is CUDA 12's own, which dropped Kepler. An unknown capability gets no
  offer, for the same reason device.gpu_supports_int8() refuses one: offering a
  download that may not run costs far more than not offering it. Not offered:
  CUDA 11.8 (270 MB). What it reaches that 12.4 does not is a driver too old
  for CUDA 12 — from before the end of 2022, where updating the driver is the
  better fix than a second GPU build — and Kepler cards, whose last driver
  branch is itself out of support; for that, it would double the GPU matrix
  this module has to keep honest. The OpenBLAS build
  (21 MB) is a second CPU build whose gain over ggml's own kernels was never
  measured here, and a choice the user cannot judge is not a feature. Win32
  builds: WinZapp is 64-bit. No Vulkan build is published for Windows.

* **The zip's layout is not known, so it is not assumed.** Whether the files
  sit in `Release/` or at the root, and whether this release still ships an
  old `main.exe` beside `whisper-cli.exe`, was not verified: the extraction
  keeps the zip's own tree and `locate_executable()` finds whisper-cli.exe
  wherever it is. A zip without one is refused (WHISPER_CPP_CORRUPTED) rather
  than run under another name — `main.exe`, where recent releases still ship
  one, is a deprecation stub, not the program.

No user-facing text lives here.
