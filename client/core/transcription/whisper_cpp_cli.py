"""whisper-cli's command line, and how to read what it writes. Pure functions.

Everything whisper_cpp_backend needs to know about the program it runs and
nothing about running it, so the parts that decide something — which flags,
what a line of stderr means, which failure the user hears — are tested without
a process, a model or Windows. The flags are those of examples/cli/cli.cpp at
release b4938, read on 2026-10-05:

* `-l` defaults to **"en"**, not to detection. Forgetting it is not an error:
  a Portuguese note comes back as fluent, invented English. So the language
  is always passed, and "auto" whenever the request does not name one.
* `-pp` prints "<function>: progress = N%" lines to stderr — the only progress
  the program reports, and what the job's progress callback is fed with.
* `-oj -of <base>` writes `<base>.json`. The text is read from there, never
  from stdout, where the program prints the transcription with timestamps:
  stdout goes to the null device, so the words never pass through a buffer
  or a log of ours on their way to the result.
* `-ng` keeps a CUDA build off the GPU; `--vad -vm <file>` runs the Silero
  voice-activity filter before decoding.

Two readings are **not yet confirmed on a real run** and are written to cope
either way: the detected language is taken from the JSON's `result.language`
and, failing that, from the stderr line "auto-detected language: xx (p = …)";
the probability only exists in that line.
