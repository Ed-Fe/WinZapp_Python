"""One transcription, off the UI thread, in phases the UI can announce.

A transcription is three waits stacked on each other — converting the audio,
loading the model (tens of seconds for large-v3), decoding it — and a blind
user staring at a window that says nothing has no way to tell any of them from
a crash. So the job announces which wait it is in, before entering it, and the
phases are symbolic codes: what they are *called* is part 6's business, in the
user's own language, exactly as with the error codes and the device reasons.

Rules this file exists to keep:

* **Nothing here imports wx.** Every callback is invoked on the worker thread,
  and part 6 wraps each one in `wx.CallAfter` — that is the same split
  core/message_queue.py makes, and it is what lets the whole pipeline be tested
  without a wx.App.

* **Exactly one finished report, whatever happens.** The UI is holding a row
  and a spoken "transcribing…" until it hears back; a path that ends without
  reporting leaves that state forever. So the callbacks are called through a
  guard that logs and swallows, and even a programming error on this thread
  becomes a BACKEND_ERROR the user is told about.

* **Cancellation is honoured in two phases and a half.** Converting is
  interruptible (the ffmpeg process is killed, not abandoned) and so is
  decoding (the backend stops consuming the segment generator). *Loading is
  not*: `WhisperModel(...)` is one blocking call into C++ with nothing to hang
  a check on, so a cancel arriving there is noticed only once the load returns
  — which for large-v3 can be tens of seconds later. Saying "checked in every
  phase" would be the comfortable version and it would be false. Whatever the
  phase, the converted temporary file is deleted before this thread ends —
  with exactly one exception, `prepared_handover`, where it is handed to the
  caller instead of deleted and the caller becomes the one who deletes it.

* **Progress is reported only while decoding.** Converting and loading have no
  fraction to give — ffmpeg's own progress is not parsed and CTranslate2's load
  reports nothing — and loading is the *longest* of the three on a large model.
  So part 6 needs an indeterminate indicator for those two phases; the phase
  callback is what tells it to put one up.

* **The hardware is probed here, immediately before the device is chosen.**
  device.py's docstring is explicit that a probe taken at startup describes a
  machine that no longer exists by the time a model is loaded: free VRAM is the
  figure being planned against, and Chromium has since loaded WhatsApp Web.

**What the log may say about a transcription.** Backend, model, device, compute
type, the language asked for and the one detected, how long the audio was and
how long the run took, and the technical text of a failure. Never the
transcribed text or any part of it, never the contact, the number or the
message id — and therefore never the audio path either, since the media file is
named after the message id. `tests/test_transcription_backend.py` walks the
logging calls of this package and fails if the text could reach one.
