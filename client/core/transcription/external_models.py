"""Whisper models the user already has, in folders WinZapp did not create.

A user who already transcribes with faster-whisper from a script of their own
has the model on disk — in the Hugging Face cache, or wherever their script put
it — and asking them to download the same 3 GB again into WinZapp's own folder
is what this module exists to avoid. It answers four questions, with no wx and
no network: is this folder a model at all, which model is it, where are the
ones already on this machine, and — once the user has said "use that one" —
where does a run load it from.

The decisions are worth more than the code:

* **A folder of the user's is never copied, moved or deleted.** Everything the
  model store does to its own root (repair, remove, move) is out of the
  question here: the folder belongs to another program, which may still be
  using it. Forgetting a reference removes the record in app.json and touches
  no file — and a reference inside WinZapp's own models root is refused
  outright, so that remove_model() on the root can never delete a model the
  user believes is "external", and a reference can never be left pointing at a
  folder WinZapp is about to move.

* **Only the digest makes a folder "the catalogue's model X".** The model store
  can trust names and exact sizes because it wrote the files itself, after
  hashing them on the way in; a folder somebody else filled has had no such
  check. So `identify()` calls a folder a *candidate* for X when every file of
  X is there at its exact size, and *verified* only when model.bin hashes to
  X's pinned sha256 — and only a verified folder is ever stored as X. This
  matters beyond pedantry: a fine-tune of large-v3 converted the same way has a
  model.bin of exactly the same size (same tensors, same dtype), and treating
  it as large-v3 would hand the automatic choice a model that is not the one it
  budgeted memory for.

* **After the check, the weights are recognised by their identity, not by
  their size.** The model store believes sizes because nobody else writes to
  its root; a folder of the user's is written to by whatever filled it, and the
  case that exists is a script re-running ``ct2-transformers-converter --force``
  into the same folder with a fine-tune: every size identical, weights not. So
  a reference records the *identity mark* of the file model.bin resolves to —
  its size and its st_mtime_ns — taken before the digest (or the trial load)
  and compared after it: a file that changed while it was being checked is not
  stored at all (ACCEPT_CHANGED_WHILE_CHECKED), and one that changes later
  makes the reference REF_CHANGED, never REF_READY. The mark is the file that
  was checked, so the gap between the check and the write to app.json is
  covered too: a change there is a mark that no longer matches. A reference
  without a mark — written by hand, or before the mark existed — is
  REF_UNVERIFIED, never ready. The file id (st_ino) is deliberately not part
  of it: on exFAT and FAT32, what a USB disk usually is, and on an SMB share,
  Windows does not promise it survives a remount, and a mark that changed on
  every replug would send the user to re-hash 3 GB for nothing until they
  learned to ignore the warning. A rewrite through any ordinary tool moves the
  mtime; the Hugging Face cache, whose blobs are named by their content, never
  rewrites one in place. The cost of the mark is in the safe direction: a
  ``touch``, or FAT32's one-hour shift of every mtime when daylight saving
  starts, asks for one more verification and never loads the wrong model.

* **The Hugging Face cache path is a shortcut to a candidate, not a verdict.**
  A snapshot folder names its repository and commit
  (``models--<org>--<repo>/snapshots/<commit>``), and when those are a
  catalogue entry's `repo` and `revision` the folder is the obvious candidate —
  but a folder name is not evidence of its contents, so the sizes are checked
  exactly as for any other folder, and the digest is still what verifies it.
  Sizes are measured on the file a name *resolves* to: in that cache the
  snapshot entries are symbolic links into ``blobs/``, or — on a Windows
  account without the symlink privilege, which huggingface_hub works around —
  plain copies, and both have to read the same.

* **A model the catalogue does not know is a choice, never a default.** Its
  shape can be checked and the backend can be asked to open it
  (`trial_load()`), but nothing says how much memory it needs, which is the
  whole question the automatic choice answers (device.auto_select_model()). So
  such a model is only ever used because the user picked it by name;
  `usable_catalogue_ids()` — what part 10b hands preferences.resolve() as
  `installed_ids` — never contains one.

* **WinZapp's own copy wins over an external one of the same model.** Both are
  the same verified bytes, so choosing costs nothing in quality, and the root
  copy is the one nobody else can change: it sits under the models lock, and no
  other program prunes it, updates it to a new revision or leaves it on a disk
  that is unplugged. The external copy is used when the root has no complete
  copy — including when the root's copy is incomplete, since a usable model
  beats an error.

* **A folder that is gone is its own state.** An external disk that is not
  plugged in, or a cache another program pruned, is neither "not installed"
  (the user knows they have it) nor "corrupted" (nothing was damaged, and
  "download it again" is 3 GB of wrong advice). `reference_state()` answers
  REF_FOLDER_MISSING and a run raises EXTERNAL_MODEL_MISSING. A folder that is
  there and changed is not "corrupted" either: REF_CHANGED raises
  EXTERNAL_MODEL_CHANGED, whose answer is to check it again, since "download
  it" is impossible for a custom model and beside the point for the rest.

* **The references are install-wide, in app.json**, beside the models folder:
  the files belong to the machine, not to an account, and one account using a
  model its sibling cannot see is not a state that means anything. Two account
  processes can add to the list at the same moment, so every write is one
  locked read-modify-write (`AppSettings.update()`); get() then set() would
  let one of them silently drop the other's addition.

**Log rule.** Folder paths go to the log — they are the diagnosis (which drive,
which cache, which spelling) and they name no message. Nothing else this module
touches could name one.

**For the UI layer on progress.** `identify()` and `accept_catalogue_folder()`
report `progress(done, total)` once per megabyte of model.bin, exactly like
model_store.verify_model() — around 3000 calls for large-v3 — so they go through
management.ProgressThrottle before any wx.CallAfter or spoken percentage. Both
hash for up to a minute and `trial_load()` loads for tens of seconds: they run
on a worker thread, never on the UI thread.

**What part 10b did with it** (the tab is `ui/dialogs/transcription_external.py`,
the work is `external_job.py`, what it says is `external_view.py`):

* Everything that touches a folder of the user's — `discover_hf_cache()`,
  `reference_state()` (so `usable_catalogue_ids()` and `model_directory()` in
  the tab), `reference_for_path()`, the accept calls — runs on a worker thread
  there, and the run itself asks `usable_catalogue_ids()` / `model_directory()`
  from `message_run` and the backend, never from the wx thread.
* Choosing a models folder that *contains* a reference is refused by the tab
  (`references_inside_root()`); `_inside()` guards the other direction.
* `accept_*()` raising the `LockTimeout` of `AppSettings.update()` is turned
  into MODELS_BUSY ("another window is busy, try again") by `ExternalModelJob`.
* EXTERNAL_MODEL_MISSING and EXTERNAL_MODEL_CHANGED are in
  `transcription_flow._SETTINGS_OFFER_CODES`: a failed run offers the tab.
* `message_run._decide()` asks `model_directory()` for whatever is not among
  the usable catalogue ids, which is how a custom model is let through and how
  a missing folder is told apart from a model that was never downloaded;
  `TranscriptionRequest.external_references` carries the references to the
  backend, whose `_model_for()` calls `model_directory()`.
* A model setting of `external:<id>` whose reference was *forgotten* is a
  retired model: `preferences.resolve()` / `sanitize_section()` replace it with
  the automatic choice and the tab says so, like any other substitution (they
  are given `custom_model_ids`, `custom_reference_backends()`).
* "Check again" is `accept_catalogue_folder()` / `accept_custom_folder()`
  called again on the reference's folder, from the tab's button of that name.
