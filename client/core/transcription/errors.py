"""Everything that can go wrong in a transcription, as one closed set of codes.

Transcription fails in a lot of ways that look identical from the outside —
nothing appears — and the user is listening rather than reading a traceback.
So a failure travels as a *code*, and only the UI layer turns it into a
sentence, in the user's own language.

The split between `code` and `detail` is the point of this module.  `detail` is
technical (a CTranslate2 message, an ffmpeg exit code) and belongs in log.log;
it is never spoken and never shown, and never carries a media file's name
either — that name is the message id, and the constructor runs it through
`scrub_media_names()`. Putting a backend string on screen would say nothing
useful to a blind user in Polish, and it is also where file paths and message
ids leak.

# Only the name, never the folder. Folders are what a transcription failure is
# diagnosed with — which drive a model sits on, which spelling of the models
# folder was compared, where a CUDA DLL was looked for — and they identify no
# message: the account folder is `accounts/<uuid4>` and every temporary comes
# out of mkstemp(). The Windows user name in a profile folder is already in
# dozens of lines of log.log outside this package, and in the frames of every
# traceback; hiding it here protected nothing and cost the error codes and
# DLL names that sat on the same line.

# lookbehind keeps it from starting mid-token and the lookahead from matching a
