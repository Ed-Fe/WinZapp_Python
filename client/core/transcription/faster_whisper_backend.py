"""faster-whisper (CTranslate2) as a WinZapp transcription backend.

Three things here are worth more than the code around them:

* **Nothing may leave the machine.** That is the whole promise of the feature —
  the audio of a private conversation is transcribed on the user's own
  computer — and the one line enforcing it is `local_files_only=True` at the
  model load. Without it, faster-whisper treats its first argument as a Hugging
  Face repository id the moment the directory does not look like a model, and
  quietly reaches for the network. The weights are on disk because part 2 put
  them there and checked them; the backend loads them from that directory and
  from nowhere else.

* **Loading is expensive, so the loaded model is cached.** large-v3 is 3 GB
  read off disk and pushed into VRAM; a user transcribing three voice notes in
  a row must pay that once. The cache is keyed on everything that changes what
  was loaded (directory, device, compute type), and `release()` exists because
  the UI has to be able to hand the VRAM back.

* **The error text is not an API.** CTranslate2's failures arrive as strings
  from its C++ layer and change shape between versions, so they are matched
  case-insensitively, by fragment. When a message stops matching, the answer
  degrades to BACKEND_ERROR — a generic "internal error" that still logs the
  real text — and never to a different diagnosis: telling a user with plenty of
  VRAM to pick a smaller model, or a user whose driver is broken to install
  more memory, sends them off to fix something that is not broken.

* **"cuBLAS could not be loaded" is the ordinary answer on most machines, not
  a broken install.** The ctranslate2 wheel ships its own DLL and a cuDNN
  *stub loader* only, and resolves cublas64_12.dll dynamically at run time out
  of the CUDA runtime — which WinZapp does not bundle (part 4 downloads it on
  demand, the way the models are downloaded). A machine carrying nothing but
  an NVIDIA display driver therefore reports a CUDA device and then fails at
  the model load, which is exactly why that string maps to CUDA_UNAVAILABLE.
  The corollary belongs to part 4: `get_cuda_device_count() > 0` does **not**
  prove CUDA is usable here, so whatever decides that the acceleration is
  available has to look for the libraries as well.

The device and the compute type are decided by device.py and arrive in the
request; nothing here re-decides them (that is what keeps the sm_120 int8 rule
in one place).
