"""From "transcribe this message" to a finished job, behind one progress dialog.

`job.TranscriptionJob` starts from an audio file and a model id. A message has
neither: the model is a decision made against this machine *now*, the audio
may not have been downloaded yet, and what is on disk is encrypted. Every one
of those steps is slow somewhere — the hardware probe was measured at 0.67 s on
a machine with no graphics card, listing the models reads every file's size,
the download is a blocking HTTP call and an audio document may be 2 GB to
decrypt — so none of them may run on the wx thread. They run here, on one
worker, ahead of the job, and the progress dialog that is already on screen
covers all of them: a user who pressed Alt+Shift+T hears the dialog open at
once, and Cancel works from the first moment rather than from the moment the
job finally starts.

`MessageTranscription` has the shape the progress dialog already drives
(`start()`, `cancel()`, and `on_progress(tick)` / `on_finished(result, error)`
exactly once), so part 6b reuses `TranscriptionProgressDialog` as it stands.
Like job.py and management.py it imports no wx: every callback runs on a
worker thread and the UI side crosses with `wx.CallAfter`.

Four rules this file keeps:

* **Decide before starting, against a fresh measurement.** The probe is taken
  here, immediately before `preferences.resolve()`, and never borrowed from
  startup — free memory is what the model is chosen against, and Chromium has
  loaded WhatsApp Web since. The installed models are listed from the folder
  that is in force (install-wide, see `preferences.stored_models_dir()`). A
  run with no backend or no usable model stops *here*, before the media is
  downloaded or a byte is decrypted: those answers are the user's to act on in
  Settings, and a two-minute download first would be a wait for nothing.

* **Cancellation is honoured where it can be, and no further.** Between steps
  it is checked; *during* the media download (one synchronous HTTP call) and
  the decryption (one call into Fernet) it is not, and a cancel arriving there
  is noticed as soon as that call returns — the same honesty job.py writes
  down for loading the model. Once the job exists, `cancel()` is forwarded to
  it under a lock, so a cancel landing between "job built" and "job started"
  still reaches it.

* **The decrypted temporary is this file's, and it goes on every way out.** It
  is the audio of a private conversation in clear; success, failure,
  cancellation, an unexpected exception and a job that never started all
  leave through one `finally`. The converted audio a failed GPU run hands over
  (`prepared_handover`) is a different file with a different owner: this
  class only passes it on, and the caller that offers the processor re-run is
  the one who discards it.

* **The log says how, never what or whose.** The same rule job.py states:
  codes, model ids and durations, never the message, its id, the contact or a
  path. An unexpected exception is logged by its type and its frames — not by
  its text, which for anything touching a file quotes the path.

  That promise covers the lines *this module* writes, and no more. A run that
  has to download the audio first goes through the panel's
  `_download_media_to_disk()` and on into `MainWindow.handle_audio_message()`
  / `get_base64_from_media()`, which predate this part and log what the rest
  of the app's media downloads log — the message id, the cache path, the media
  URL. Those lines are there whenever a transcription triggers a download;
  bringing them under the same rule is the privacy audit's (part 8), not
  something this module can vouch for from here.
