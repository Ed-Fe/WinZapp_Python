"""What the user chose for transcription, and what that means for one run.

Four settings live in each account's own settings.json — backend, model, device
and language (plus the checkbox that says whether the language is detected at
all) — and one, the folder the models are downloaded into, deliberately does
not: it is install-wide, in app.json, because the model files themselves are
shared by every account (that is why `model_store.default_models_dir()` sits
under `global_dir()`) and one account pointing somewhere else while its
siblings keep reading the old folder is not a state that means anything.

Three rules shape everything below.

* **"Automatic" is a stored value, not an absent one.** Every setting here has
  a "let WinZapp decide" position and it reaches disk as a literal sentinel —
  `"auto"` for the backend, the model and the device, `"interface"` for the
  language. A blank would be ambiguous the day one of these defaults changes:
  nothing on disk would separate "the user picked what happened to be the
  default" from "the user never opened the dialog", which is precisely the
  state the one-shot migrations in `core/utils.py` exist to repair after the
  fact. Storing the sentinel is how this section avoids ever needing one.

  **`auto_detect_language` is the exception, and it is stored as a plain
  bool.** It is a checkbox: it has two positions and no third behaviour, so
  there is nothing for a sentinel to *mean* — a stored `"auto"` would have to
  be mapped back onto one of the two the first time the dialog was opened,
  which reintroduces the same ambiguity one OK later. What that costs is real
  and is accepted with open eyes: this is the default most likely to be
  reconsidered, and the day it flips, an install carrying True cannot be told
  from one that was never touched. The answer then is a one-shot migration
  with its own flag, exactly like `migrate_voice_message_mode_default()` —
  a known, bounded price rather than a novel one.

* **A stored value that no longer exists resolves to automatic, and says so.**
  A model id a later catalogue drops, a language code that was never valid, a
  backend this install does not have — each is the normal state of a
  settings.json that outlived the version which wrote it, not a fault, so none
  of them raises. But the substitution is *reported* through
  `Resolution.substitutions`: transcribing with a quietly different model than
  the settings dialog is showing is how a user spends an afternoon wondering
  why "large-v3" sounds like "tiny", and a blind user has no visual cue at all
  that anything was swapped.

* **Nothing here touches the machine.** The hardware probe, the installed model
  ids and the usable backend ids all arrive as arguments, for the reason
  `device.py`'s docstring gives at length: a decision that measures its own
  inputs cannot be reproduced anywhere but on the hardware that made it, and
  "which model does a 4 GB card get" is exactly the question no test runner can
  answer for itself.

The resolved fields are the ones `TranscriptionJob.__init__` takes, and no
more. The device the run ends up on and the compute type are deliberately *not*
here: the job re-probes immediately before it decides, which is the whole point
of `device.probe_hardware()` never being reused, and a second answer kept here
would only be the older one.

    detection and simply never picked which language instead — the stored
    LANGUAGE_INTERFACE sentinel. With detection on, which is the default, it
