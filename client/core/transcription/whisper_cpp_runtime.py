"""The whisper.cpp program (whisper-cli.exe and its DLLs), fetched on demand.

cuda_runtime's counterpart for the second backend: WinZapp does not ship the
binaries, it downloads one of the Windows builds ggml-org publishes with each
whisper.cpp release, the first time the user asks for it. Which release,
which builds a machine is offered and how zip member names are judged are
whisper_cpp_builds' — pure, and pinned there. The decisions here:

* **Verified before it is opened, and extracted defensively.** The zip is
  downloaded through model_store.download_verified_file(), so it reaches its
  final name only once size and sha256 match. Every member is then checked by
  `safe_member_path()` (no absolute path, no drive, no `..`, no `:` stream)
  and no symlink is written — the digest makes a hostile zip unlikely, and the
  check makes it harmless.

* **Published by one rename, with the manifest inside.** The tree is
  extracted into `<build>-<tag>.part/`, each file fsynced, then a manifest
  (`winzapp_manifest.json`: the release, the zip's digest, every file's
  relative path, size and sha256, and where the executable is) is written into
  it, and the folder is renamed into place. Whatever the build folder held
  before is renamed aside (`<build>.old-<n>`) first and deleted after — the
  folder is WinZapp's own, and a stray file in it must not block every later
  install. So `installation_state()` never sees half an install as a whole
  one, and an install from an earlier pin reads as INCOMPLETE with
  `installed_release` saying so. A rename refused because a file is held open
  (an antivirus, a running whisper-cli) is retried briefly, then reported as
  WHISPER_CPP_BUSY — never as a failed download to be fetched again.

* **Shared, so locked.** Under `global_dir()`, like the models; every mutation
  holds model_store's directory lock keyed on this root, and another
  process holding it is WHISPER_CPP_BUSY.

Nothing is resumed: the zip is scratch, deleted once extracted or on failure,
for cuda_runtime's reason — a dead 671 MB `.part` in the global folder is
invisible to the user and nothing else would collect it.

No user-facing text lives here: failures travel as TranscriptionError codes.
