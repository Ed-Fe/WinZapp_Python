"""transcription_flow.py — transcribing one message, from the keypress to the text.

`ConversationsPanel` only wires this in (a context-menu item and Alt+Shift+T);
everything between "the user asked" and "the text is in front of them" is
here, and everything slow is further down, in `core.transcription.message_run`,
which runs on a worker thread behind the progress dialog part 5c-2 built.

What the user hears, and what only appears. A finished transcription can carry
a headline and up to three caveats — about sixty words in a row, read out over
whatever the user does next. So:

* **Spoken**: the headline ("finished", "no speech was found", the error), and
  the voice-filter warning *always*. That warning is the one degradation a
  listener cannot detect — without the filter Whisper can end a note with a
  sentence nobody said, in the same voice as the real ones — so it may not
  depend on the user tabbing to it.
* **Shown only**: the language and confidence caveats. They sit in the result
  window's own read-only field, above the text, where Shift+Tab reaches them,
  and the spoken headline ends with a four-word pointer to them ("there are
  warnings above the text") when there are any — the pointer costs less
  attention than the notes themselves and still says they exist.

Each failure is reported exactly once. The media download goes through
`ConversationsPanel._download_media_to_disk()`, which says nothing, rather
than `_ensure_media_on_disk()`, which says it itself — with a message box
posted through `wx.CallAfter` that would surface on top of the modal progress
dialog, and a second sentence from here would then be the same failure told
twice. The sentences for "offline" and "the download failed" are the ones the
rest of the app already uses for media, chosen here from `run.media_status`.

Speech lands *after* the focus move it belongs to. Every outcome ends by
putting the focus somewhere — the message the user came from, the message
field, the result window — and a screen reader cancels its speech when the
focus changes. So the focus moves first, and the sentence follows through
`wx.CallAfter`; in the result window it is spoken from inside its own modal
loop for the same reason (see transcription_result.py).

The re-run on the processor is the one place a second progress dialog opens.
It is a new run the user explicitly agreed to after being told why the first
failed, not the same wait continuing, and the question has to be asked with no
progress dialog on screen — a Yes/No box on top of a modal whose only button
is Cancel would leave the user two dialogs deep in the middle of a run.

A finished transcription is kept with its message (part 7,
`core.transcription.stored`), and from then on the message offers it instead
of the wait: Alt+Shift+T and "Ver transcrição" open the same result window
with the stored text, saying when and with which model it was made, and
repeating every note that still applies — the voice-filter warning above all,
since a transcription made without the filter is exactly as untrustworthy the
tenth time it is read. "Transcrever novamente" is the run above; its result
replaces the stored one. "Apagar transcrição" asks first, because it throws
away minutes of work with one key. A run that finishes after the sender deleted
the message for everyone is neither kept nor shown: one sentence says so, and
no window opens (`WITHDRAWN_I18N_KEY`).

A locked chat's content stays behind the vault, and the vault can close in
the middle of a run: the auto-lock timer fires inside the progress dialog's
modal loop, closes the conversation and says so. So before anything of the
result is shown or said, the vault is asked again whether the chat is hidden
now (`MainWindow.is_chat_hidden_by_vault()`, `_hidden_by_vault()` here). If it
is, no window opens, no headline or note is said — "no speech was found" and
the detected language are about the recording too — and the focus stays where
the vault put it. The result is still kept when storing still finds the
message with the conversation closed: it goes into the message's encrypted
record like the rest of that chat, where nothing shows it until the vault is
opened, and it spares the user the minutes they already waited. Storing
finds it in the chat's own records; a note brought in by "mensagens
anteriores" lives only in the conversation panel's lists, which the closed
conversation no longer offers, so it is not kept (SAVE_MISSING) where it
would have been with the vault open. One sentence says which of the two
happened, and nothing more (`HIDDEN_BY_VAULT_I18N_KEY`). Failures and
cancellations are still said as always: they describe the run, not the note.
The same question is asked once more when the result window closes through
"Inserir na mensagem": the vault can close while the user is reading, and the
message field would carry the text into whichever conversation opens next.
That refusal has a sentence of its own (`INSERT_REFUSED_BY_VAULT_I18N_KEY`):
nothing finished then — the window may hold a transcription reopened from
storage — and what the user needs to hear is that the text was not inserted.

Nothing here logs the message, its id, the contact or a path: the same rule as
the whole transcription package, checked by `tests/test_transcription_flow.py`.
