        Why the hold exists at all — the rule comes straight from NVDA's own

        A wx.ListCtrl row is one MSAA object whose *name* is the whole rendered
        line, so rewriting a row to add "reproduzido" raises a name change, and
        NVDA speaks the **entire row** — but only when that row is the object it
        currently believes has focus. So the fix is not to time the write, it is
        to never write the row NVDA is looking at while focus is moving away
        from it.

        The previous protection tried to order the two events instead: move
        focus, then fire the "played" refresh from the same callback,
        documented as "this can't lose the race because both actions run in the
        same callback, in this order". It could, for two measured reasons:

        * ``refresh_message_status()`` does not write anything — it queues the
          row and starts a 120 ms coalescing timer. Measured on the real code
          path, the write landed 142 ms *after* the focus move. That is a
          margin, not a guarantee, and users on several machines with current
          NVDA reported it losing.
        * Worse, that margin can go negative. ``mark_audio_message_played()``
          also POSTs a played receipt to WhatsApp, which echoes the same status
          back over Socket.IO onto ``on_message_status_update()`` with
          ``skip_panel_refresh=False`` — bypassing the chain protection
          entirely. Measured on the real code path: the row was written 95 ms
          *before* the focus move, so NVDA read the whole finished row out and
          only then announced the newly focused one. That is exactly the
          reported symptom, and it is a hole the ordering approach cannot cover
          because the second write does not come through the chain at all.

        Holding removes both: during the chain nothing is written, so there is
        no event to lose a race with. At release time focus sits on the last
        voice note of the sequence while every held row is an earlier one, so
        each name change lands on a non-focused object and NVDA stays silent by
        its own rule — no timing assumption anywhere.

        Idempotent: the hold flag is cleared first, so the several places that
        can end a sequence (the last voice note, the user stopping playback,
        leaving the conversation) may all call this without writing the rows
        twice. It does NOT check whether the chain is still running — call it
        only once the sequence is genuinely over, which is why the call sites
        sit next to where _is_in_audio_chain is cleared.

        added at the END) and the full rebuild, and its absence is what the 60s
        poll was landing on. Two very ordinary things change a row that is
        already on screen without adding or removing any row:

        * a delivery/read receipt moving a message's ``status``;
        * a reaction, which is a record that never becomes a row of its own and
          instead changes the text of ANOTHER row.

        Neither is expressible as a tail append, so both fell through to
        ``populate_messages(preserve_focus=True)`` — DeleteAllItems() plus one
        Append() per row, followed by re-Focus()/re-Select()ing the row the user
        was already on. That last part is the damage: a native ListView row is a
        single MSAA object, so re-focusing it fires EVT_LIST_ITEM_FOCUSED and
        the screen reader re-announces a row the user never moved off, once a
        minute, mid-read. It cannot be fixed by making the rebuild quieter —
        the focus event is unavoidable once the control has been cleared — so
        the rebuild has to not happen.

        Refuses anything that moves, adds or removes a ROW, because only the
        rebuild knows where a row goes:

        * a changed record whose timestamp moved (the list is sorted by

        * a reaction whose target is not currently rendered (paginated out, or
          in another conversation) — there is no row to repaint;
        * everything _signature_changed_ids() already refuses on its own: a
          different conversation, a moved unread separator, an empty or
          repeated id;

        inteira entre as duas assinaturas foi coberta assim; quem chama
        reconstrói quando não foi.

        É o caso mais comum que sobrou passando pelo rebuild: mensagem nova. O
        painel já a acrescenta ao vivo em on_incoming_message(), mas o refresh
        de fundo que vem segundos depois (sync_chat_messages() ->
        _refresh_open_conversation_after_sync(), o backfill de histórico, a
        rodada de 60s) só sabia comparar a assinatura e chamar
        populate_messages(): DeleteAllItems() mais um Append() por linha, para
        pintar de novo o que já estava na tela — numa janela que agora pode ter
        milhares de linhas. Mesma ideia de _repaint_message_rows(), que já faz
        isso para estrela/fixar/apagar, e de refresh_chat_row_text() na lista de
        conversas.

        Na prática o caminho normal acrescenta ZERO linha: a mensagem já foi
        pintada ao vivo, e o que este método faz é reconhecer isso e adotar a
        assinatura, transformando o rebuild seguinte em nada. Acrescentar de
        fato é o caminho de quem chegou pelo sync sem passar pelo live.

        Recusa tudo que não seja "linhas novas no fim, nada mais mudou", porque
        aí o rebuild é a única coisa que sabe onde a linha vai:

        - qualquer linha existente que mudou de texto ou sumiu (a comparação
          por id de _signature_changed_ids(), que já devolve None sozinha para
          conversa trocada, separador movido ou id vazio/repetido);
        - registro novo que não vira linha — a reação é o caso comum: ela muda
          o texto de OUTRA linha, e a assinatura não diz de qual;
        - registro novo mais antigo que a última linha, que entraria no meio da
          lista ordenada por timestamp, não no fim;
        - qualquer reordenação dos registros antigos, que a comparação por id
          não veria e o sort estável do rebuild veria;
        - lista fora de passo com o controle, lista vazia (acrescentar na lista
          vazia com foco reproduz o pulo de foco para a linha 0 que o Freeze()
          de populate_messages() documenta) e a lista de placeholder;
        - o sufixo ", N de M" ligado (ver _row_position_suffix_active()).

        Uma exceção à recusa por registro não exibível: reação a um status
        NOSSO é linha de verdade (_is_displayable_message() ->
        reaction_targets_status()), então ela é acrescentada como qualquer
        mensagem. O rebuild também a poria em _reaction_map, e o atalho não —
        sem divergência visível, porque essa entrada é chaveada por um id de
        status@broadcast, que não tem linha nesta conversa para decorar.

        Consequência deliberada, não efeito colateral: o separador de não
        lidas que on_incoming_message() insere ao vivo sobrevive a este
        refresh, e é seguro porque só se acrescenta na cauda: _unread_sep_idx
        continua apontando para a mesma linha e _dismiss_unread_separator()
        continua funcionando. A assimetria que existia aqui — o separador ao
        vivo era removido pelo primeiro rebuild que qualquer OUTRA mudança
        provocasse, porque este caminho não gravava _first_unread_msg_id — foi
        fechada do outro lado: _update_unread_separator_for_incoming() grava a
        âncora e a contagem, e _place_unread_separator_for_rebuild() as lê de
        volta.
