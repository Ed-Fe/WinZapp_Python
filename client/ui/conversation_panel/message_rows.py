"""MessageRowsMixin — part of ConversationsPanel (see ui/conversation_panel/__init__.py).

Writing the open conversation's rows into ``messages_list`` without ever
clearing it.

A native ListView row is one MSAA object. ``DeleteAllItems()`` followed by
re-``Append()``ing every row hands the screen reader a brand-new list, and
putting focus back on the row the user was sitting on re-announces it even
though nothing about it changed — the "NVDA reads the focused message again,
for no reason" bug. It cannot be made quiet (see
docs/traps/screen-reader-speech.md), so the rebuild must not happen: every
write goes through ``_sync_message_rows()``, which deletes and inserts only the
rows that really differ and rewrites a row's text only when the text differs.
A row that did not change — the focused one above all — is not touched.
