"""The Transcription tab of Settings, split out of settings_dialog.py.

Everything the tab owns: the pure helpers that decide what it says and which
buttons are enabled, and `TranscriptionTabMixin`, the methods that build the
page, load and apply its values and run its model/CUDA jobs. The mixin is the
tab of `SettingsDialog` — it reads the dialog's own `self` (notebook, dirty
flag, main_window) — so it lives beside it rather than as a page of its own,
the way AISettingsPage can: that one owns its state, this one shares the
dialog's Apply/OK/language-change life cycle.

The user-facing name is "Transcrição local" (Whisper, on this computer). The
online AI tab, "IA online", is `ai_settings_page.AISettingsPage`.

        Two things this deliberately does *not* do, both of which it used to.

        **It does not probe the hardware.** `device.probe_hardware()` imports
        ctranslate2, counts CUDA devices, asks NVML and, where a card is
        present, LoadLibrary's cuBLAS — seconds on a machine with a graphics
        card, on the wx thread, inside `SettingsDialog.__init__`, i.e. before
        there is a window for a screen reader to announce. device.py accepts
        that cost against "nothing next to a transcription"; the budget for
        opening Ctrl+, is not the same budget. Nothing here needs the answer:
        the substitutions below are provably independent of it (neither
        `_resolve_backend()`, `_resolve_device_preference()` nor
        `_resolve_language()` is even handed the probe, and `_resolve_model()`
        appends its own before `auto_select_model()` is reached), so an empty
        probe and an empty installed list produce the identical warning list.
        The measurement happens on the first visit to the tab instead —
        `_enter_transcription_page()`, which is what `model_none_reason` and
        the "you asked for a card this machine has not got" notice are read
        off. Part 5c needs the same answer for its download offers: take it
        from there, or off the UI thread altogether, never from here.

        **It does not sanitize.** `resolve()` reports a value it had to replace
        and `sanitize_section()` is what stops that report repeating — but it
        stops it whether or not anybody was told, and this method runs on every
        single open of this dialog, including the one where the user came to
        change the interface language and never looked at this tab. Consuming
        the warning there is the exact silent swap preferences.py exists to
        prevent. Both the sanitize and the write-back are therefore gated on
        the tab having actually been shown.

        also spoken once, through `speak_output` like every other announcement

        it must not run before the warning was delivered.
