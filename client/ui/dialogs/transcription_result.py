"""transcription_result.py — the window a finished transcription is read in.

A transcription is a block of text a screen-reader user needs to *read at
their own pace* — word by word, back up a line, spell a name — so it lives in
a read-only multi-line `wx.TextCtrl`, the one control every screen reader
navigates like a document. The shape follows `_show_message_text_popup()`
(conversations.py), made modal because three of its four buttons act on the
conversation the user came from.

Decisions worth keeping:

* **Focus starts on the text.** It is what the user asked for, and NVDA reads
  the line under the cursor as the dialog opens.

* **The caveats get a read-only field of their own, above the text, and only
  when there are any.** A `wx.StaticText` nobody is focused on is silent to a
  screen reader; a read-only `TextCtrl` is reachable with Shift+Tab from the
  text and is read like any other field. Above rather than below because it
  is about the text, and a user tabbing forward from it should land on the
  buttons, not on a note they have already been pointed to.

* **What is spoken is decided by the caller and said once the dialog is on
  screen.** Spoken *before* `ShowModal()`, it lands underneath the screen
  reader's own announcement of the new window — NVDA cancels speech when the
  foreground changes — and the one sentence that must be heard (the voice
  filter warning, see transcription_flow.py) is exactly the one that would be
  cut. So it is queued with `wx.CallAfter` before `ShowModal()`, which runs it
  from inside the modal loop, after the window and its focus exist: the same
  arrangement `TranscriptionProgressDialog._start_job()` uses for its first
  line.

* **Mnemonics are per language and change the letter, never the word.** The
  label is what the screen reader reads on every pass of the focus, so it
  stays the plain word; where the natural letter is taken (Close is "&Fechar"
  in Portuguese, "&Close" in English, "&Zamknij" in Polish), another letter of
  the same word carries the Alt key.

* **Insert does not act from in here.** It ends the dialog and the caller
  writes into the message field once this window is gone, because it is the
  one exit where the focus must land somewhere other than the message the
  user came from — and a focus move made while a modal dialog is still up is
  undone when the dialog closes.
