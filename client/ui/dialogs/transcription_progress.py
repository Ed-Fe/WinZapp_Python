"""transcription_progress.py — the dialog a long background job runs behind.

Downloading a 3 GB model, hashing it, moving the models folder, installing the
CUDA libraries — and, in part 6, transcribing a voice message — are minutes of
work on a background thread, and a user with no window to read has no way to
tell a working download from a hung one. So the shape is node_download.py's: a
line saying what is happening, a gauge, and Cancel.

**The dialog knows nothing about which job it is running.** It is handed a
factory and a line of text, and it neither builds a job nor looks a sentence
up — that is what lets part 6 run its own `job.TranscriptionJob` behind it
instead of writing the app's second progress dialog. A caller whose job has
phases (part 6's has three, two of them with no fraction to report) keeps the
line current through `set_status()`, which is reached from its own `on_phase`
callback: by the time any phase fires, `run()` is executing and the dialog
object it closes over exists.

Four things this shape is paying for:

* **Every callback arrives on the job's thread.** `ManagementJob` and
  `TranscriptionJob` both import no wx at all, deliberately, so each callback
  crosses to the wx thread through `wx.CallAfter` here and nowhere else.
  Driving wx controls from two threads is not a race that shows up while
  testing; it is a crash in somebody else's session.

* **The reports come per megabyte.** ~3000 of them for large-v3, which is
  ~3000 cross-thread posts *and* a screen reader reading numbers for the
  length of the download. The job's own throttle is what reduces that to a
  gauge move twice a second and three spoken figures, so this dialog passes no
  throttle of its own.

* **The job could finish before there is a loop to end.** `EndModal()` on a
  dialog whose `ShowModal()` is not running asserts — the same wx rule the
  pairing dialogs are built around — and a finished report with nowhere to go
  would leave this dialog on screen for good. The job is therefore started
  from a `wx.CallAfter` queued *before* `ShowModal()`, so the first thing it
  can possibly report to is the modal loop already dispatching its start. For
  the same reason a `start()` that *raises* is turned into a finished report
  rather than allowed to propagate: nothing above a queued call catches it,
  and a dialog with no close box whose Cancel waits for a report that will
  never come is the settings window locked shut.

* **A wx.StaticText is not read by a screen reader that is not looking at it.**
  NVDA reads the static text of a dialog as it opens; JAWS and Narrator do
  not, and none of them re-read it when it changes. So the line is spoken as
  well as shown — it is the only thing that says *which* of the actions is
  running — and every later change to it is spoken too.
