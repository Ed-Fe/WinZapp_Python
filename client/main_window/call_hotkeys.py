"""CallHotkeysMixin — part of MainWindow (see main_window/__init__.py).

Answer, reject or hang up a call from any window. Two system-wide keys,
changeable in Settings > Keyboard shortcuts (shipped as Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Enter
and Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Backspace):

* answer: answers the call that is ringing, brings the call window forward and
  puts the focus in it. A video call is answered the way its Answer button
  does, with the camera on.
* end: rejects the call that is ringing -- a group offer too, which can be
  rejected though not answered; with no call ringing, hangs up the one in
  progress.

WinZapp used to need its own window in front (or the global "show WinZapp" key
first) before a call could be answered, which for a screen-reader user means
leaving what they are doing.

The keys are registered with Windows only while they can do something --
``answer`` while a call that can be answered rings, ``end`` while any call
rings or a call is in progress -- so they are free for every other program the
rest of the time. With several accounts open, a press of the end key that
reaches an account with nothing ringing first offers the reject to the other
running accounts (``_hang_up_unless_another_account_rings``): the account
ringing could not take the key from the one holding it for its call.

Every change of the incoming-call state and of the call in
progress asks for a sync (``_request_call_hotkey_sync``); the sync itself runs
once the event that changed things is over, so it never sees the moment
between "the alert stopped" and "the call was answered" as "no call at all".
