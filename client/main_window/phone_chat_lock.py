"""PhoneChatLockMixin — part of MainWindow (see main_window/__init__.py).

WhatsApp's own Chat Lock, set on the phone and reported by WPPConnect in each
chat record's ``isLocked`` field (core/phone_chat_lock.py has the rules). WinZapp
treats such a chat exactly like one in its own locked-chats vault: it leaves the
main list, the archived list, notifications and the tray, and appears only in the
Locked chats panel after the vault is opened. ChatLockMixin.is_chat_locked() asks
this mixin, so every place that already hides a locked chat hides these too.

The one difference: WinZapp cannot undo it. The phone's code is the only thing
that unlocks it, so Unlock is not offered for these chats (see
ChatLockMixin.unlock_chat()).

The membership set is persisted for the same reason archived_chats is: a chat
record never carries ``isLocked`` on disk, so after a restart nothing says which
chats the phone locked until the first list-chats answers. Without the persisted
set those chats would sit in the main list for that first moment. It holds keyed
JID fingerprints (core.chat_lock_vault.jid_fingerprint), never the JIDs: which
contacts someone hid behind Chat Lock must not be readable from messages.db,
the same rule as the vault's own index (ChatLockMixin._load_chat_lock_vault()).

Methods run with ``self`` bound to the MainWindow instance.
