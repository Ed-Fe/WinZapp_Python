        message codec — main_window._convert_wav_to_ogg() despite the name
        just runs it through ffmpeg, which reads the real container/codec
        rather than trusting the extension, so this also works for a
        picked .mp3/.m4a/.aac file from _on_choose_media_status(), not just
        a WAV recorded here) and post it as a voice status via
        /send-status-voice-base64 (see messageController.ts's
        sendStatusVoice64() — mirrors send_audio_message()'s own
        send-voice-base64 call in main.py).

        *is_temp_file* must only be True for a file WE created (the
        recorded WAV) — deleting *path* unconditionally used to also
        delete the user's own picked file (e.g. an .mp3 chosen from the
        media picker) right out from under them.

        *report_result* controls whether a failure pops its own MessageBox
        here. _send_all_media_statuses_bg() passes False and aggregates
        instead — one popup per file used to stack into a flood of blocking
        dialogs when several files in a batch failed at once (same failure
        mode already fixed for save_data(), see main.py's
        _SAVE_ERROR_DIALOG_COOLDOWN comment).
