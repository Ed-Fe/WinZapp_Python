# Local transcription

**Read `docs/traps/transcription.md` before changing these files.** Short form:

No top-level import of the backend or wx in `client/core/transcription/`: a copy without it must still open (whisper.cpp, or `BACKEND_MISSING`). No int8 on a card unless chosen, and never from sm_120 up or on an unknown capability. whisper.cpp's CUDA build only for [5.0, 12.0), and whisper-cli always gets `-l`. Catalogues pin revision, sizes and sha256. A single-language model forces its language, and the automatic choice never downloads a third-party model. Resolve an unsupported precision before the load, because CTranslate2 refuses it. Probe free memory right before the run, off the wx thread. The models folder is install-wide: `coord_locks.models_lock()`, `canonical_dir()`, `_app_settings` with the underscore. A user's own model is never copied or deleted. Downloads go through `tls_trust`. `vad_used is False` is always spoken. The stored text lives in the encrypted record and needs both defences. Never log the text, the contact or the message id.
